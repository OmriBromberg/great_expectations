This guide will help you connect Great Expectations to data in a Snowflake database. You will be building a `Datasource` configuration, and using it to verify connectivity. By the end of this how-to guide, you should have a `Batch` representing a slice of data in your database, and a working code snippet that can be used as a starting point for more complex configurations.

:::note Prerequisites: This how-to-guide assumes you have already:
- Completed the [Getting Started Tutorial.](../../tutorials/quick-start.md)
- Have a working installation of Great Expectations.
- Have data on Snowflake database that you would like to connect to.
:::

## Steps

### 1. Install required packages

Next make sure you have the necessary packages for Great Expectations to connect to your Snowflake database.

```console
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install snowflake-connector-python
pip install snowflake-sqlalchemy
```

### 2. Determine how to add credentials to configuration

Great Expectations provides multiple methods of providing credentials for accessing databases. For our current example will use a `connection_string`, but other options include providing an Environment Variable, and loading from a Cloud Secret Store.  

For more information, please refer to [Additional Notes](#additional-notes).

```python file=../../../../integration/code/connecting_to_your_data/database/snowflake_db.py#L12
```

<details><summary><b>What's in the config?</b></summary>
<p>
<ConnectionStringDetails />
</p>
</details>


### 3. Load the DataContext into memory

<details><summary><b>More Details</b></summary>
<p>
Open up a Jupyter Notebook in the same directory as the `great_expectations/` folder. Import any necessary packages or modules.

```
```

</p>
</details>

Load your DataContext into memory using the `get_context()` method.

```python file=../../../../integration/code/connecting_to_your_data/database/snowflake_db.py#L21
```


### 4. Write your configuration as a YAML

Here is an example configuration:

```python file=../../../../integration/code/connecting_to_your_data/database/snowflake_db.py#L27-L41
```

:::note What does the configuration contain?
A `Datasource` named `my_postgres_datasource`.

An `ExecutionEngine` with a `connection_string`.

The configuration also contains 2 `DataConnectors` by default:
1. A `RuntimeDataConnector` named `default_runtime_data_connector_name` which loads your data into a Batch, and a default `batch_identifier` which identifies your Batches.
2. A `InferredAssetSqlDataConnector` named `default_inferred_data_connector_name` which allows you to name a `whole_table` to retrieve your Batch.

### 5. Save configuration to DataContext.

Save the configuration into your DataContext by running the `add_datasource()` function.

```python file=../../../../integration/code/connecting_to_your_data/database/snowflake_db.py#L65
```

### 6. Test Configuration

Test your configuration by retrieving a `Validator` from Great Expectations using a `BatchRequest`.

<Tabs
  defaultValue='runtime_batch_request'
  values={[
  {label: 'Using a query', value:'runtime_batch_request'},
  {label: 'Using a table name', value:'batch_request'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="runtime_batch_request">

Here is an example of loading a batch from a query. As you can see in the following snippet, when you fetch a Batch of data, you actually create a `Validator`, which is a Batch + ExpectationSuite. This allows you to perform operations like `.head()` to see 
the first few rows of your table, as well as run Expectations directly. 

```python file=../../../../integration/code/connecting_to_your_data/database/snowflake_db.py#L68-L83
```

:::note What does the RuntimeBatchRequest contain?
1. `datasource_name` and `data_connector_name` are directly from our `Datasource` configuration.
2. `query` is passed in as a `runtime_parameter`, and is used to select 10 rows from table `taxi_data`.

**Note** : Make `data_asset_name` and `batch_identifiers` default.
:::


  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="batch_request">

Here is an example of loading a batch by naming a table. As you can see in the following snippet, when you fetch a Batch of data, you actually create a `Validator`, which is a Batch + ExpectationSuite. This allows you to perform operations like `.head()` to see 
the first few rows of your table, as well as run Expectations directly. 

```python file=../../../../integration/code/connecting_to_your_data/database/snowflake_db.py#L86-L97
```

:::note What does the BatchRequest contain?
1. `datasource_name` and `data_connector_name` are directly from our `Datasource` configuration.
2.  `data_asset_name` is `taxi_data`, which is the name of the table you want to retrieve as a batch.  
The reason you can do this is because of the `InferredAssetDataConnector` that is configured to retrieve `whole_table` by default.

**To Discuss**: How much do we mention `ActiveDataConnector` here?
